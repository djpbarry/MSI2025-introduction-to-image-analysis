   ![FIJI Webpage](./../assets/FIJI.png)

2. To avoid any permissions issues, install FIJI is in your home directory:
   * PC: `C:\users\<your user name>`
   * Mac: `/Users/<your user name>`

   > **WARNING: FIJI *must* be installed in a location where it has write permission - otherwise, it cannot update itself**

3. Start FIJI and allow the updater to run:

   ![FIJI Webpage](./../assets/Updater.png)

4. (Optional) If the updater does not run automatically, select `Help > Update`:

   ![FIJI Webpage](./../assets/Run_Updater.png)

5. If FIJI produces any error messages, it is most likely because it does not have the necessary permissions to update itself - return to step #2 and double-check the location of the installation.
